# unsupervizedCountry
Hi Data Lovers!
I made unsupervised cluster and self organizing map model to countries all around the world to find the optimal number of clusters based on 9 different criteria such as inflation, GDP, child mortality etc. I used K-means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering with principle component analysis to reduce the dimension. You can find the clustering and som modelling scripts at Clustering_Country.py and plots at plotly.py.
